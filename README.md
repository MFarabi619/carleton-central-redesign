# Carleton Central Re-design

---

Project submitted for [uOttaHack 7](https://2025.uottahack.ca/) for the [Gadget](https://gadget.dev/) challenge.

# 🌟 Inspiration

Carleton Central is potato. Need it to be less potato.

x students are currently enrolled at Carleton University.

x students are enrolled in the CS program.
x students are enrolled in the SWE program.

# 🚀 What it does

Makes it less potato.

# 🛠️ How we built it
Gadget.

# 🤔 Challenges we ran into
- Reading the docs and learning the Gadget CLI from scratch.
- Seeding the database with mock data.
- Creating a design system from scratch.
- Collecting user pain points.
- Prioritizing features to work on.

# 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Project managing really well and distributing areas of ownership early.
- Limiting scope early on, and adding features progressively only as required.
- Communicating blockers in a timely manner to adjust priorities.

# 🧠 What we learned
- UX research is hard.
- Creating user personas is hard.
- Debugging is hard and stressful.
- Gadget is awesome.
- Regardless of how good the tool is, you still need to fundamentally solve the problem first.

# 🔮 What's next for the project
- Raising awareness of the tool's existence
  - Could use instagram, tiktok, cuHacking docs site, word of mouth, posters etc.
- Rather than approach Carleton now, let students begin using it, and provide their thoughts.
  - Build up traction to draw Carleton University's attention, let budget be allocated, and be hired into the department directly to integrate the tool directly with their back-end.
- Could develop a browser extension to re-write and re-style the html.
